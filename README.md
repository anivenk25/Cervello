
# Cerevello : AI-Powered Real-Time RAG System with Ticketing and Multimodal Support

This project is a real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, powered by OpenAI's LLMs, integrated with a FastAPI backend and a multimodal ingestion pipeline. It enables users to interact with enterprise knowledge through document upload, querying, and support ticketing, all while leveraging vector search via Qdrant.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** using OpenAI and Qdrant
- **Multimodal ingestion pipeline**: Supports `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.png`
- **OpenAI Agent + Tool integration** to dynamically call backend services
- **FastAPI microservices** for RAG & ticketing
- **Support ticketing system** with MongoDB
- **Semantic vector search** using OpenAI embeddings
- **Client endpoints** for interacting with the system in real-time

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This system is composed of several interconnected services:

### 1. 📦 RAG API (FastAPI Server)
Endpoints to:
- `/query`: Search and retrieve knowledge with OpenAI + Qdrant
- `/upload`: Bulk upload documents
- `/update`: Update existing vector entries
- `/delete`: Delete documents
- `/llm-query`: Basic LLM RAG
- `/mcp/query`: OpenAI Agent-based query routing with tools

### 2. 🧾 Ticketing API (FastAPI Microservice)
Endpoints to:
- `/create-ticket`: Submit a new support request
- `/tickets`: View all tickets
- `/tickets/{userId}`: View user-specific tickets

### 3. 🧰 OpenAI Agent & Tools
Uses:
- `search_docs`: Queries knowledge base
- `add_docs`: Uploads new documents
- `update_doc`: Updates vectorized entries
- `delete_doc`: Removes documents from the vector DB

### 4. 🔗 Multimodal Ingestion Pipeline
Handles file ingestion and embedding:
- Text extraction (`pytesseract`, `python-docx`)
- Embedding with `text-embedding-3-small`
- Insertion into Qdrant
- Result logging to JSON

### 5. 🧠 Databases
- **Qdrant Cloud**: Vector database for storing embeddings
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Stores tickets and user interactions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. 📥 Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anivenk25/Cervello.git
cd rag-multimodal-assistant
```

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

We use `Poetry` for dependency management.

> Ensure Python >= 3.10 is installed.

```bash
poetry install
```

If using a specific group:
```bash
poetry install --with linters
```

### 3. 🔐 Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root and configure:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_key
QDRANT_URL=https://your-qdrant-url
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
```

## 🧪 How to Use

### ➕ Upload Documents

- Send `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.png` files to the `/upload` endpoint.
- Text will be extracted and embedded via OpenAI.
- Stored in Qdrant for semantic retrieval.

### 🔍 Search with RAG

- Hit `/query` with a natural language question.
- Top-k relevant documents retrieved from Qdrant.
- OpenAI responds with a generated answer.

### 🧠 Agent Mode

- Use `/mcp/query` for enhanced query with tool calling.
- OpenAI auto-selects appropriate tool like upload/search/update.

### 🎫 Create Tickets

- The system may suggest creating a ticket.
- User can edit and submit via `/create-ticket`.
- Stored in MongoDB and retrievable anytime.
